I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.\n\nimage\n1861×912 105 KB\n\nIn this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain “110”. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show “110” because this doesn’t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.\n\nAnd also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again. So is it okay ?"

Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\n\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\n\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like “AQ1.1 Q3” which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - “Need help in calculating the N^{th} prime number”\n\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\n\n\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\n\nUse of abusive/strong language\n\nPosting support/logistics related query\n\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\n\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\n\n\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors.

It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What’s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker. Neither does give me much understanding anyway. It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up. The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\n\nSummary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\n\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I’m willing to hear different opinions.\n\nI’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop."

        "content": "Okay, I will explain it to you.\n\nUpon visiting discourse and signing in with your account, you get ‘cookies’ containing information that can be used to authorize you. These cookies are sent with each subsequent request you make to discourse, if the website does not recognize these cookies, they simply reject your request with a status code of 403.\n\nIf you want to scrape the posts, you need to get these cookies. So, where are these cookies stored? Well, just sign into discourse with your IITM account (in Chrome). Then, visit the following URL:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/session/current.json\n\nOnce the page has opened and you can see JSON data, do the following:\nright click > inspect > application > cookies > https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/.\n\nNow, you will see a bunch of cookies, which are similar to a python dictionary containing key-value pairs. You only care about two such keys, one is _t and the other one is _forum_session.\n\nSave the value of these cookie keys in a python file like my_cookies.py:\n\n# my_cookies.py \n_t = \"your _t cookie\"\n_forum_session = \"your _forum_session cookie\"\n\n\nNow, these can be imported into other files using:\nfrom my_cookies import _t, _forum_session\n\nauth_cookie: dict = { '_t' : _t , '_forum_session': _forum_session }\n\n\n\nNote that these cookies keep changing, when you make new requests you get different values that replace the current values of your session. You can think of the session as a user.\n\nNow, look at my previous reply:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/help-required-in-project-1-scrapping-discourse-data/179153/2?u=23f1000917\n\nThe requests module is used to send requests to websites in python. You need to install it using pip install requests. You create a session object and add your cookies in it. This automatically handles the changing and replacement of cookie values when you make requests.\n\nSearch for a tutorial on the requests module to understand how to make requests using it. Just know that you can do the something like this:\n\nimport requests \n\nURL = \"https://example.com/latest_threads.json\"\nsession = requests.Session()\nresponse = session.get(URL)\nif response.status_code=200:\n    data = response.json() # get json data \n\n\nLastly, watch the live sessions conducted by IITM on 10th June and next few days. You can find them in your google calendar."

After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good but, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\n\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\n\nThank you."

It may be recoverable, but for future make sure you have regular backups of your work in the cloud like on OneDrive or Google Drive. Then recovery from fatal erasures is trivial.\n\nAs far as how to recover the files totally depends on what happened and if you have any recovery systems in place.

The current deadline of June 14 is unfortunately clashing with several other academic and co-curricular commitments.\n\nWe have Paradox Fest scheduled just before the deadline, along with multiple assignment submissions across other courses. Due to this, I am finding it difficult to allocate sufficient time and focus towards completing the project with the quality it deserves.\n\nI genuinely want to put in my best effort for this project and would be extremely grateful if the deadline could be extended by a few days to allow for proper completion."
