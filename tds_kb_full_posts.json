    "content": "This category is created to address subject-specific queries related to Tools in Data Science\n\n- Why should people use this category? What is it for?\n\n\nThe larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by\n\nElaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question\n\nSharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed\n\n-  Are there any rules for posting in this category?\n\n\nBefore you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\n\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\n\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like “AQ1.1 Q3” which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - “Need help in calculating the N^{th} prime number”\n\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\n\n\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\n\nUse of abusive/strong language\n\nPosting support/logistics related query\n\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\n\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\n\n\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors. They will have the authority to decide whether a post violates forum rules/guidelines. You can flag/report any such violations that you observe by clicking on  icon on the post. Please do mention the reason why you are flagging the topic.\n\n  - What are the disciplinary actions if some one violates the rules and guidelines of the forum? \n\n\nThe flagged posts that violates forum rules/guidelines will be hidden. Repeated violation of the rules can result in the offender being removal from the forum."

    "content": "@carlton and @Jivraj\n\nRespected Sir\n\nIt was my first time doing web scraping and other tasks required for this project. After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good but, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\n\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\n\nThank you."
